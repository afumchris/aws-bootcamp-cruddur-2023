### Introduction

Week 6/7 objectives revolved around deploying containers on ECS (Elastic Container Service) using Fargate, hosting container images on ECR (Elastic Container Registry), addressing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) challenges using a load balancer, and configuring a custom domain. 

### Health Check

health check involves evaluating various aspects of the application to ensure it is functioning properly and meeting the desired requirements.

#### performing health check to test RDS connection:

  - create a test script and make it executable `backend-flask/bin/db/test` as seen in this [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/97fbe8a7f0f31fe7d8589afd7c7985a0c822fdaf#diff-fbf3b7a44dbc91b3e8d181ab9bb8a8c92c3e76840879fa7e8e636b917603c521)
  - fix `update-sg-rule` file path in `.gitpod.yml` file as seeen in this [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/97fbe8a7f0f31fe7d8589afd7c7985a0c822fdaf#diff-370a022e48cb18faf98122794ffc5ce775b2606b09a9d1f80b71333425ec078e)

Manually run the command `export GITPOD_IP=$(curl ifconfig.me)` in the top directory, then navigate to the `backend-flask` directory and execute `./bin/rds/update-sg-rule` to update the security group. After that, run `./bin/db/test` to confirm the connection status. If everything is successful, you should see the expected message as shown in the screenshot below.

#### Health check for the flask app:

  - Modify the `app.py` file with health check endpoint for flask app as seen in this [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/97fbe8a7f0f31fe7d8589afd7c7985a0c822fdaf#diff-0014cc1f7ffd53e63ff797f0f2925a994fbd6797480d9ca5bbc5dc65f1b56438)
  - Create a health-check script and make it executable `backend-flask/bin/flask/health-check` as seen in this [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/97fbe8a7f0f31fe7d8589afd7c7985a0c822fdaf#diff-01d7ad6d634a3ec30374d54f33e9e024f562ff3eca15fdea99bb1119f41de4be)

### ECS Cluster and ECR Repository

Create an ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster and an ECR (Elastic Container Registry) repository to store and manage the container images.

it is necessary to configure your AWS Account ID and HONEYCOMB API KEY as an environment variable:

```sh
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=123456789012
gp env AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=123456789012

export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=$HONEYCOMB_API_KEY"
gp env OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS="x-honeycomb-team=$HONEYCOMB_API_KEY"
```

#### Create Cloudwatch Log Group

To create a CloudWatch log group for ECS cluster and configure the log retention policy for a specific number of days, you can use the following command:

```sh
aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name cruddur
aws logs put-retention-policy --log-group-name cruddur --retention-in-days 1
```

#### Create ECS Cluster

create ECS cluster with the following command:

```sh
aws ecs create-cluster \
 --cluster-name cruddur \
 --service-connect-defaults namespace=cruddur
```

#### Create ECR Repositories and Push Images

Create repository for Python base-Image, backend-flask and frontend-react-js.

##### Python Base-Image

Execute this command to create a cruddur-python repository:

```sh
aws ecr create-repository \
 --repository-name cruddur-python \
 --image-tag-mutability MUTABLE
```

###### Login to ECR

To log in to the ECR repository you created for the Python base image and enable pushing images to the repository, you can execute the following command:

```sh
aws ecr get-login-password --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com"
```

###### Set URL

set path for the address that will map to cruddur-python repository with this command:

```sh
export ECR_PYTHON_URL="$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.amazonaws.com/cruddur-python"
echo $ECR_PYTHON_URL
```

###### Pull Python Base-Image:

```sh
docker pull python:3.10-slim-buster
```

To see what images are installed run `docker images`.

###### Tag Image:
```sh
docker tag python:3.10-slim-buster $ECR_PYTHON_URL:3.10-slim-buster
```

###### Push Image:
```sh
docker push $ECR_PYTHON_URL:3.10-slim-buster
```

##### Backend-flask

To utilize the Python image stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), you need to copy the URI of the image into your backend-flask Dockerfile as seen in this [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/97fbe8a7f0f31fe7d8589afd7c7985a0c822fdaf#diff-6f2b9638ec8f4b5a82a7ad3dce05eb963109f5a50c83a9aa342ae6dc0e5f374e). By doing this, you can reference and use the specific image stored in ECR during the Docker build process. Before pushing the image, ensure that you are logged in to ECR.

###### Create backend-flask Repository:
```sh
aws ecr create-repository \
 --repository-name backend-flask \

Based on the provided commits, create separate files holding the AWS policies for the `CruddurServiceExecutionRole` [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/97fbe8a7f0f31fe7d8589afd7c7985a0c822fdaf#diff-140ff34ff4760d0e7e2c4fbf70b1c1d07b7ac054bb074512615f53f6f03f3398) and `CruddurServiceExecutionPolicy` [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/97fbe8a7f0f31fe7d8589afd7c7985a0c822fdaf#diff-d48147539acff3a143fc19696e28187238e9a56bf6788bcd816a34572897a6f6). Then, proceed to establish the ExecutionRole and associate the policies using the provided commands:


```sh
aws iam create-role \
  --role-name CruddurServiceExecutionRole \
  --assume-role-policy-document file://aws/policies/service-assume-role-execution-policy.json

aws iam put-role-policy \
  --policy-name CruddurServiceExecutionPolicy \
  --role-name CruddurServiceExecutionRole \
  --policy-document file://aws/policies/service-execution-policy.json

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchFullAccess \
  --role-name CruddurServiceExecutionRole

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy \
  --role-name CruddurServiceExecutionRole
```

Next, create the TaskRole named "CruddurTaskRole" and attach the necessary policies to it:

```sh
aws iam create-role \
    --role-name CruddurTaskRole \
    --assume-role-policy-document "{
  \"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",
  \"Statement\":[{
    \"Action\":[\"sts:AssumeRole\"],
    \"Effect\":\"Allow\",
    \"Principal\":{
      \"Service\":[\"ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com\"]
    }
  }]
}"

aws iam put-role-policy \
  --policy-name SSMAccessPolicy \
  --role-name CruddurTaskRole \
  --policy-document "{
  \"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",
  \"Statement\":[{
    \"Action\":[
      \"ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel\",
      \"ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel\",
      \"ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel\",
      \"ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel\"
    ],
    \"Effect\":\"Allow\",
    \"Resource\":\"*\"
  }]
}"

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchFullAccess \
  --role-name CruddurTaskRole

aws iam attach-role-policy \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess \
  --role-name CruddurTaskRole
```

Go to the AWS Management Console and access the IAM (Identity and Access Management) service. Verify if the task and execution roles for the task definition have been successfully created in the console.


#### Backend-flask ECS Task Definition

Using the provided [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/732daa60d14c9f31e9b7f6750f440d809b09c1b5#diff-fce4cbfaaa6ae500dea2961ebd2e8395ff961a7a764b1cebc1f11325d50a2866) as a guide, create a Task Definition file  `aws/task-definitions/backend-flask.json`. Be sure to modify the values in the JSON file to match those of your AWS account.

##### Register Task Definition for Backend-flask:
```sh
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://aws/task-definitions/backend-flask.json
```

Navigate to the AWS Management Console and go to AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service). Check the Task Definitions section to verify if the task definition has been successfully created in the console.

##### Security Group for Backend-flask Service

To obtain the DEFAULT_VPC_ID and DEFAULT_SUBNET_IDS required for creating a security group named `crud-srv-sg` with inbound rules for port `4567`, you can use the following AWS CLI commands:

```sh
export DEFAULT_VPC_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-vpcs \
--filters "Name=isDefault, Values=true" \
--query "Vpcs[0].VpcId" \
--output text)
echo $DEFAULT_VPC_ID

export DEFAULT_SUBNET_IDS=$(aws ec2 describe-subnets  \
 --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=$DEFAULT_VPC_ID \
 --query 'Subnets[*].SubnetId' \
 --output json | jq -r 'join(",")')
echo $DEFAULT_SUBNET_IDS
```

To create a security group named `crud-srv-sg` and allow inbound traffic on port `4567`, execute the following commands:

```sh
export CRUD_SERVICE_SG=$(aws ec2 create-security-group \
  --group-name "crud-srv-sg" \
  --description "Security group for Cruddur services on ECS" \
  --vpc-id $DEFAULT_VPC_ID \
  --query "GroupId" --output text)
echo $CRUD_SERVICE_SG

aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id $CRUD_SERVICE_SG \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 4567 \
  --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```

Navigate to the AWS Management Console and select EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). Go to the Security Groups section to confirm if the security group, `crud-srv-sg`, was created successfully and if the inbound rules for port `4567` were set accordingly.

 - Configure Hosted Zone:
    - Access Route 53 > Hosted zones in the AWS Management Console.
    - Create a new hosted zone for `adikaifeanyi.com` with the "public" type.
    - Copy the provided NS record values.
    - Update the nameservers in the Namecheap DNS settings.
 - Request SSL Certificate:
    - Go to Certificate Manager (ACM).
    - Request a public certificate.
    - Add the domain names `adikaifeanyi.com` and `*.adikaifeanyi.com`.
    - Once the certificate is issued, select it.
    - Click "Create records in Route 53" to generate two CNAME records in Route 53.
 - Configure Load Balancers:
    - Access Load Balancers in the AWS Management Console.
    - Add a listener to redirect HTTP (port 80) to HTTPS (port 443).
    - Create another listener for HTTPS (port 443) and forward traffic to `frontend-react-js` using the SSL certificate.
    - Edit the rules for HTTPS (port 443) to include a condition that sets the Host Header as `api.adikaifeanyi.com` and forwards traffic to the `backend-flask` target group.
 - Set up Record Sets:
    - Navigate to the hosted zone for `adikaifeanyi.com` in Route 53.
    - Create a record set without a specific record name.
    - Set the type as "A - Route Traffic to an IPv4 address and some AWS resources".
    - Choose "Alias to Application and Classic Load Balancer" as the routing target.
    - Specify the correct region and load balancer.
    - Set the routing policy as simple routing.
    - Repeat the above step for the record name `api.adikaifeanyi.com`.

To get domain name working, update task definition for `backend-flask` and rebuild the `frontend-react-js image`

  - Enable expanded output mode by entering `\x` on.
  - Execute the command `select * from users;` to view the existing users.
  - Use the following command to insert the mock user into the users table:

```sh
INSERT INTO public.users (display_name, email, handle, cognito_user_id)
VALUES
  ('Londo Mollari','lmollari@centari.com' ,'londo' ,'MOCK');
```

  - Execute the command `select * from users;` again to verify that the mock user has been successfully inserted. To exit the database connection, type `\q`.

To verify if messaging is working, visit your domain name and you should be able to send a message as shown below

### Enable X-Ray For Frontend and Backend Task Definitions

To enable X-ray for both backend and frontend task definitions, implement the following modifications:

  - In the `backend-flask/services/user_activities.py` file as seen in this [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/c1a24a13baf2b4bdd2eff53c97f5a90a1edf16b3#diff-f5a1708fa9e56be428a37d6314e4ad7be8af74d9332ada2bc16913095fb0b4c6), Comment out the following, import statement for `xray_recorder` from the `aws_xray_sdk.core` module, the `xray_recorder.begin_subsegment('mock-data')`, and the `xray_recorder.end_subsegment()` line, which closes the subsegment.
  - as seen in this [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/e90233a9a75b63a9b049a1bd38095e99088af7b0#diff-fce4cbfaaa6ae500dea2961ebd2e8395ff961a7a764b1cebc1f11325d50a2866) and this [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/e90233a9a75b63a9b049a1bd38095e99088af7b0#diff-b1ee9974828856aa33e1eae739e5a1e7b07a9bdbee3b5665e040a451cba663ff), In the backend-flask task definition, the `healthCheck` command was modified from `/backend-flask/bin/flask/health-check` to `/backend-flask/bin/health-check`. A new container definition named "xray" was added for both files. This container is responsible for running the AWS X-Ray daemon, which is used for tracing and analyzing requests in the application.


Register the frontend and backend task definitions, and also after making changes to the `backend-flask/services/user_activities.py` file, the next step is to build the backend image incorporating these modifications and push it to the production environment.

###### Build Image:
```sh
./bin/backend/build
```

###### Push Image:
```sh
./bin/backend/push
```

###### Register backend task definition:

Create a script `bin/backend/register` as seen in this [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/e90233a9a75b63a9b049a1bd38095e99088af7b0#diff-0dabce0e76eea0e68c31089b7e457f85d82d751171f11179e5762ce5ed02c2bc) and execute it with the following command `./bin/backend/register`

###### Register frontend task definition:

Create a script `bin/frontend/register` as seen in this [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/e90233a9a75b63a9b049a1bd38095e99088af7b0#diff-8921592caf8bb1a59a42ff3e4f695a43b1c50087a5fd029fe181e8ed2f133353) and execute it with the following command `./bin/frontend/register`

###### Deploy backend-flask:
```sh
./bin/backend/deploy
```

###### Deploy frontend-react-js:

Create a script `bin/frontend/deploy` as seen in this [commit](https://github.com/afumchris/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/e90233a9a75b63a9b049a1bd38095e99088af7b0#diff-10873cdb459376dde5bea7e6d65ce9f9dcdc51632d8d371039592d0d78336f48) and execute it with the following command `./bin/frontend/deploy`

Go to the AWS console, access ECS (Elastic Container Service), and navigate to the "Tasks" section. There, you should find the following information displayed.

### Cost Consideration

To optimize costs on the AWS console, set the Fargate services to 0, which will help conserve your AWS budget. By doing so, you'll prevent any unnecessary usage and charges related to Fargate services while still keeping other essential resources active as needed.
